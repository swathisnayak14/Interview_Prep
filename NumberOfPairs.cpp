// Given two arrays X and Y of positive integers, find the number of pairs such that xy > yx (raised to power of) where x is an element from X and y is an element from Y.

// Example 1:

// Input: 
// M = 3, X[] = [2 1 6] 
// N = 2, Y[] = [1 5]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 
// The pairs which follow xy > yx are 
// as such: 21 > 12,  25 > 52 and 61 > 16
