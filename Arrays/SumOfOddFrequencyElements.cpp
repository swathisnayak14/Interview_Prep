//Sum of all odd frequency elements in an array
// Given an array of integers containing duplicate elements. The task is to find the sum of all odd occurring elements in the given array. That is the sum of all such elements whose frequency is odd in the array.

// Examples: 

// Input : arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}
// Output : 9
// The odd occurring element is 3, and it's number
// of occurrence is 3. Therefore sum of all 3's in the 
// array = 9.

// Input : arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 40}
// Output : 60
// Elements with odd frequency are 10, 20 and 30.
// Sum = 60.
